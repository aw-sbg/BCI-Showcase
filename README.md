# Showcasing basic signal processing stuff

To run this notebook, you first need to create a python environment, this can easyliy be done using pixi:

[Install pixi](https://github.com/prefix-dev/pixi?tab=readme-ov-file#installation)

then navigate to the directory this repo is located (or just start a terminal here) and type:
````
pixi install
````
followed by
````
pixi shell
````
to activate the environment

If you are using Visual Studio Code to run this notebook, you might need to select the correct python-interpreter after that.

After that you should be good to go :)
